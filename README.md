# Responsive Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio which will showcase who I am as well as projects I have built. There is a contact form where you can reach out to me. This portfolio was created with Bootstrap for responsive design.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```
Text editor of your choosing, internet connection
```

### Installing

Say what the step will be

```
1. Create a folder directory called 'responsive-portfolio'.
2. Inside folder, create 3 files (index.html, contact.html, portfolio.html).
3. Inside responsive-portfolio create folder directory called 'assests';
4. Inside assets folder create two folders called 'css' and 'images'.
4. Your images folder will be where you will keep all images for the website.
5. Inside the css folder create a file named style.css. This is the file where you will create your css.
6. Add README.md file if you would like.
